@article{Perez-Liebana2018,
abstract = {â€”General Video Game Playing (GVGP) aims at designing an agent that is capable of playing multiple video games with no human intervention. In 2014, The General Video Game AI (GVGAI) competition framework was created and released with the purpose of providing researchers a common open-source and easy to use platform for testing their AI methods with potentially infinity of games created using Video Game Description Language (VGDL). The framework has been expanded into several tracks during the last few years to meet the demand of different research directions. The agents are required to either play multiples unknown games with or without access to game simulations, or to design new game levels or rules. This survey paper presents the VGDL, the GVGAI framework, existing tracks, and reviews the wide use of GVGAI framework in research, education and competitions five years after its birth. A future plan of framework improvements is also described.},

@inproceedings{Schaul2013,
abstract = {We propose a powerful new tool for conducting research on computational intelligence and games. `PyVGDL' is a simple, high-level description language for 2D video games, and the accompanying software library permits parsing and instantly playing those games. The streamlined design of the language is based on defining locations and dynamics for simple building blocks, and the interaction effects when such objects collide, all of which are provided in a rich ontology. It can be used to quickly design games, without needing to deal with control structures, and the concise language is also accessible to generative approaches. We show how the dynamics of many classical games can be generated from a few lines of PyVGDL. The main objective of these generated games is to serve as diverse benchmark problems for learning and planning algorithms; so we provide a collection of interfaces for different types of learning agents, with visual or abstract observations, from a global or first-person viewpoint. To demonstrate the library's usefulness in a broad range of learning scenarios, we show how to learn competent behaviors when a model of the game dynamics is available or when it is not, when full state information is given to the agent or just subjective observations, when learning is interactive or in batch-mode, and for a number of different learning algorithms, including reinforcement learning and evolutionary search.},
